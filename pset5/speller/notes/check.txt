Check

- case insensitivity
- assume strings with only alphabetical characters and/or apostrophes

if the word exits, it can be found in the hash table

which bucket would the words be in?
- hashtable[hash(word)]

search in that linked list
- strcasecmp

            cursor - points to the very first node in the linked list
            ^
head----->[A|-]--->[B|-]--->[C|-]--->[E|-]--->0 = NULL

traverse a trie

for each letter in input word
    go to corresponding element in children
        if NULL, word is mispelled
        if not NULL, move to next letter
    once at end of inout word
        check if is_word is true
