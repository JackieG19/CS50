inputting zero or negative numbers into forms when only positive numbers are expected,

inputting floating-point values into forms when only integers are expected,

trying to spend more cash than a user has,

trying to sell more shares than a user has,

inputting an invalid stock symbol, and

including potentially dangerous characters like ' and ; in SQL queries.
